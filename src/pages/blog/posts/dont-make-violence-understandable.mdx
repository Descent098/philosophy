Imagine for a second that you have stolen something from a store. Something small, say a pack of gum. You are caught by a policeman on your way out the store. What is your willingness to try to kill the policeman, flee, and kill any others that try to stop you? Well, hopefuly for most people that sounds like an insane over reaction to the situation. If you live in most countries you probably will get a small fine, and maybe some time in jail depending on the circumstances. Killing someone over something like that would be insane. What if instead the punishment was execution for you, and your immediate family? Allowing the officer to live, and process the charges would mean your parents, spouse, kids, would all be killed for the association with you. Would you be willing to kill them first?

When dealing with any sort of justice system there is typically some notion of what a "just" punishment is, and that decision is not arbitrary. The choice of where the balance of force should lie, and the justifications for it are often pivotol to the public perception, and adherence to these rules. Coercion by fear of punishment is a tool that a state should not weild lightly. The choice to strike the balance of how much force to apply (physically, financially etc.) is delicate. The decision to dole out cruel and unusual punishment is one that systems try to avoid for several reasons. Before I get to those reasons, a lot of this argument hinges on an important principle, retaliatory violence. 

## Retaliatory Violence

When looking at any situation, when some sort of force is applied to someone (physical, emotional, financial, etc.), there will be a reaction. If a cop stops someone on the street, and makes them feel uneasy, even if they haven't tried to harm the person, there will be a response to being made to feel uneasy. A common example of this is the urge many people (including myself) have had to want to defund police after receiving a traffic ticket. The grumbling anger of being inconvenienced leaves a retaliation of being annoyed at the police in general. Likewise, outside of just the state, if someone hits someone else in the bar the person will likely retaliate violently. In general the reactions to a situation tend to follow a sort of [tit for tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat) pattern. If someone accidentally drops something of yours and dents it, the first response is not to murder everyone they've ever known (if you're relatively sane). In other words, with some variability, the retaliation, and response to being agreived is proportionate (in some way) to what's happened. So, how does this apply to justice?

## An Expensive Stick of Gum

Justice systems are always some balance of retribution and rehabilitation. Retribution in that you want to seek a punishment for crimes in order to disincentivize people from doing them in the first place. Rehabilitation is the process of keeping someone who has done a crime from re-offending. Generally some form of retribution is necessary to keep people from just taking the law into their own hands. If a store owner is stolen from every day, and feels as if no one is going to help them, it's likely they will take matters into their own hands. If it's their livelihood on the line, the likelihood that it's worth it to start hurting people stealing from you goes up. 

In that spirit the choice for example to fine someone who stole something is a punishment that seems to fit the crime. The person was trying to cause financial harm to someone, and they incur a financial harm because of it. The force applied is relatively proportional to the harm being caused, and disencentivizes stealing without threatening ones life. This is probably why the initial reaction to the start of the first paragraph was confusion. It makes no sense to try to kill the officer because what you're avoiding is not enough of a big deal to overcome the moral, and legal consequences of killing them. Being fined is not enough to kill someone over. However, escalating the force from a fine to executing oneself, and their families, now provides a reasonable justification for a "me or them" mentality. The calculation is now whether I should let myself and them die for the life of the officer. In this case many more people would attempt to kill the officer if not to save themselves then to save their families. 

Additionally, the likelihood that citizens would quickly start rebelling against law enforcement goes up drastically with each body. If you're willing to kill people over something as small as petty theft, there's no benefit to assisting the police, or even tolerating them as a citizen. For matters of self-preservation this will probably not result in outright fights in the street, but even just being willing to look the other way when crimes are committed against officers becomes more reasonable. Though depending on the duration of unreasonable treatment, outright violence is also a likely outcome.

## Sympathy for the Devil

Within this dynamic there is also a degree of hereocism you instill in those willing to stand against it. As an example, if you are an oppressive government, with many cruel and unusual punishments, people who act out against you will be rewarded. These people don't have to do it for moral reasons either. Someone killing dozens of police officers in a tyranical regime might just do it for fun, but the presumption from other people will be to sublimate their own hatrid into valor for the person "fighting back". This provides a sheild for the worst people to both be violent, and be praised for it. Essentially leading to the old addage that "one mans warlord is another mans freedom fighter".

## Where is the Line?

For many people the points in this article up until now are probably pretty obvious, and banal. Particularly with the examples given, however, many governments are increasingly testing these limits. The decision to exile as a punishment for publicly countering the states perspective is an interesting edge case that teeters the line of justified violence. You may be unwilling to entertain violence on someone elses behalf, but if someone close to you, your partner, or even your best friend or family were on the cusp of being exiled, the analysis gets different. Particularly if this exile is dovetailed with the possibility of endentured servitude in a foreign country. Yet this is not an unwarranted concern depending on your circumstances in the US as of late. 

Additionally, more subtle circumstances can effect this "line of violence". It's no secret that wealth inequality is becomming an ever-increasing gap. With this, it's not uncommon for what was previously a slap-on-the-wrist punishment to become a pseudo death sentence depending on circumstances. Someone deciding to shoot a cop over a $200 fine sounds insane, until that $200 becomes a black hole of debt that is feasibly unrecoverable. The calculation is now the persons life, or your ability (perceived or actual) to feed yourself and your family. We've already seen an off-shoot of this calculation with how much public support was shown for Luigi Mangione[^1]. The prospect of the American public broadly supporting an unrepentant murderer sounds insane, until the person he murders becomes emblematic of a problem (health care policy) that has bankrupt millions of people.

## Get to the Point

My point with all of this is not some celebration of a sort of fuck around and find out mentality. It's primarily an analysis for why the ["let them eat cake"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_eat_cake#:~:text=%22Let%20them%20eat%20cake%22%20is%20the%20traditional,or%20her%20poor%20understanding%20of%20their%20plight.) mentality can only hold for so long. The choice to overtly oppress groups of people in a country come with consequences. The overt cruelty shown in recent months of taking away SNAP benefits[^2], the treatment of immigrants[^3], and the hints of extending these punishments to those who have lived in the country their whole lives[^4], is a very topical example. The calculation as an illegla immigrant now shifts from willingly submitting yourself to a long process, paying taxes, and trying to work towards citizenship, to potential exile and extorsion in a torture camp of a country you've never lived in. It's rare to see such brazen indifference to the potential consequences of ramping up this kind of violence. With every shift and change toward the autocratic the calculation changes drastically, and it's very worrying. The more and more you push the calculation the more and more "reasonable" the responses become. Likewise, it seems to me that once these sorts of choices become more commonplace, the densensitization to kicks in, making similar choices for even less "justified" reasons becomes more palitable. 

As an example, consider the possibility this thinking also cascades to second order effects. I would like to believe in most cases I would try to be level-headed and calm, but if I found out a neighbour filed a report that got a member of my family deported to a torture camp it would be hard to not retaliate violently. Likewise, if I knew that outcome was likely and someone arrived to take them away, I'm unsure of what would happen. This is arguably the sort of belief that leads people to support someone like Luigi Mangione in the first place. Imagine your elderly parents get denied for coverage of a procedure, which then leads to their death. As far as many are concerned the health insurance companies "killed" their parent, and so someone killing a CEO to "send a message" is cathartic. 

All of this is to say that these are the sorts of calculations that should be all-around avoided. Fines should be reasonable enough to not ruin ones life, and financial stability across ones country should be improved for many reasons, but one of which is to avoid being "pushed" to these sorts of choices. Policies that exist are not abstract bits of paper (or literal bits on a computer). They affect outcomes of peoples' lives, and the stability that affords them the ability to make good choices. The carrot of building a better society seems to have failed it's job of driving towards reasonable policies, hopefully it doesn't come to the stick of violence before this approach is reconsidered.
