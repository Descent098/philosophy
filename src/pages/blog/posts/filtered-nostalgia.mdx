The good old days never existed, at least not the ones you remember. It's easy as one ages to allow nostalgia to creep into our perception of the past. 

## The Corrupted Youths (TODO)

- Socrates in Plato's apology
    - Aristophanes' and his play
        - How much of what people believed about socrates came from a caricature instead of reality
- 

## This Reccurance is Uncanny (TODO)

- Nietzsches Eternal Recurrance
- "History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes"


## Reliability of Memory (TODO)

- Your memory is unreliable in general
- Additionally on top of the unreliability you will filter your memories to only remember certain parts

## Types of Filters (TODO)

...

### Age (TODO)

- When your bones don't hurt, you tend to be happier, that sublimates on the memories

### Saturation (TODO)

- You can't be as mad as you were forever, meaning negative experiences, part of the negativity has to dull
