As time goes on more and more people are becoming conscious of the problems in the world. We even have a name for this in common parlance that feels positive, when someone becomes more aware of this we call them "woke". This waking up then to the world around them, and it's problems is a positive process of understanding and broadening one's perspective, right?

## A little of everything please
As the internet has become more and more popular everyone is fighting for people's attention. Advertisers, journalists, activists and sometimes advertising activist prop themselves up on an economy of attention. The notion of becoming more woke is a matter of getting people's attention on issues that "wake them up" to what they need to do. Unfortunately I would argue that this has led to the majority of people having no real causes to fight for.

Most people go around and as they see the atrocities of the world it's taken in as being almost like a product itself. The social issues that exist become the newest vogue for those who want to "express themselves". The hottest new war that we can attach our existing ideology to, the most recent tragedy that proves our point, and god I hope there's just a few more shootings that proves me right!
## Attention deficit
I don't mean to actually suggest that we need **more problems** in the world, what I am instead arguing is that the problems themselves are often presented in a shallow and vain manner. The issues of the day become a matter of shopping for the latest tragedy that you can use to reinforce your beliefs. This in turn means that in order to be a good little advocate you need to ensure you keep yourself on a steady diet of the events in the world around you. There's no time to sit and keep talking about the event from last week, that's yesterday's news, come on we've got something more important, this week's tragedy.
## Deafening noise
In this ever growing list of situations that happens lies the problem. Because of the necessity to process information so quickly it is rare that anyone gets any of the background information to a situation. Not only that, but as topics have become more politicized there is now a direct incentive to lie about everything. After all if only a few details were different about the events then they would show people what's **really going on in the world**.

On any given day someone might "wake themselves up" with a dozen 5 minute videos explaining "the truth" about a problem in the world. Fraught with the latest examples and everything. If there's examples it must be real. But again as I said earlier we are in an attention economy, and keeping that attention has nothing to do with accuracy. The nuances of a situation, the decades of cultural context to the latest international calamity, the proof of a given event happening how it's claimed, all these things are a hinderance. If we stop to present things properly, then the "information" gluttony can't be satiated. Wasting time with facts isn't important, there's injustice around and people need to be made aware!

## Tuning in
As is somewhat evident in the tone for this article I am skeptical to say the least about all of this. Especially in north America, activism has become the new ethical vogue. This in and of itself is arguably a problem, but it's outcomes in our existing information landscape are the real problem. I can throw a few rocks into a crowd and at least one person will wholeheartedly believe some sort of conspiracy. Worse they will have dozens of "examples" that might take hours to disprove. This is even worse when real situations happen and people just "shift" a few details to suit their narrative better. Being dubious takes time and effort, so is this just an article to tell you that you need to spend **even more time** reading about issues?

Yes and no. My point is actually an unintuitive one at first. You should spend more time reading, but about the topics that **actually matter to you**. Stop taking in all the deafening background noise and spend time focusing on the topics that actually speak to you. A good rule of thumb is to at least be more informed about the problems you yourself would be willing to go out and put the "active" into activism for. Being misinformed on a ton of topics I would argue is more morally irresponsible than being well informed on a smaller number of topics. 

You don't need opinions on the latest 20 tragedies, instead you can just have a well informed opinion on a few topics. You don't need to spread lies to your friends so they know how "woke" you are, just be actually awake on the topics that matter. Find the topics that are meaningful enough you are willing to take action, not just endlessly pontificate, and passively consume information about.
